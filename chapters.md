> ## Excerpt
>
> Architects look at thousands of buildings during their
> training, and study critiques of those buildings written
> by masters.  In contrast, most software developers only
> ever get to know a handful of large programs
> well—usually programs they wrote
> themselves—and never study the great programs of
> history.  As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes
> rather than building on one another's successes.
